# Simon Says App

This is a web app that uses Javascript to play Simon Says. jQuery is used to change classes but other than that it is not used.

This was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's front curriculum. The CSS took a while to figure out, but I got there eventually. I'm not happy with the Simon Says being loaded with position: absolute but if I return to this project I'll figure out a way to do it more elegantly.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.
* User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
* User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
* User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
* User Story: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
* User Story: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
* User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
* User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: The game will remember my highest score. 
* User Story: I can change the difficulty of the game from Easy to Medium to Hard. 
* User Story: I can keep playing past 20 because I'm not a baby who needs to be told 'Okay, you made it to 20! Great job! Now start back at 1 and do it again.' No. I'M A HUMAN. I'LL DO WHAT I WANT. I'LL PLAY TO 100. 1000. ONE MILLION. 

## To Do

* Make the CSS more elegant for handling the 4 buttons. It looks nice, but it doesn't hold well if the user is using a really small screen with low height. 
* Responsive.
